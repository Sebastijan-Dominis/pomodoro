# üçÖ Mediterranean Pomodoro üçÖ

## üöÄ Overview

This web application allows users to run a pomodoro timer with custom time ranging from 15 minutes to 60 minutes per one pomodoro session. Users can then track how many hours and minutes they've spent focused over the last day, week, or month. The general vibe of the website is Mediterranean, hence "Mediterranean Pomodoro".

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Vite
- **Backend:** Fastapi
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

## üõ† Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python 3.12+
- Docker (optional)
- sqlite (installed with requirements) or PostgreSQL

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sebastijan-Dominis/pomodoro.git
cd pomodoro
```

### 2. Set up backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- define .env variables, as described in .env.example
- optionally:

```bash
docker build -t your-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 your-backend
```

### 3. Set up frontend

```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
```

- define .env variables, as described in .env.example

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

### backend

- API_URL=http://localhost:5173
- SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-jwt
- ALGORITHM=your-algorithm-of-choice-for-jwt

Option 1:

- DB_URL=sqlite:///./pomodoroapp.db
- DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=DEV

Option 2

- DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION
- DB_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/db_name

#### extra notes

- going with the sqlite option will automatically create an sqlite database within your backend folder
- if opting for postgresql, make sure to create an actual database locally or remotely, run it, and use a valid url to connect to it (should be defined in the DB_URL environment variable)
- using sqlite is recommended for development and local use (easy to use), while postgresql is recommended for deployment

### frontend

VITE_API_URL=url-to-backend

## Database Schema

- if one chooses to manually create the PostgreSQL database, it should be done like so:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;

CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
username VARCHAR UNIQUE,
email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
hashed_password VARCHAR UNIQUE
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pomodoro_session;

CREATE TABLE pomodoro_session (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
duration INTEGER,
created_at TIMESTAMP,
owner_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
